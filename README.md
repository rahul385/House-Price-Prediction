## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There are no additonal libraries required to run the code beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

To train a mahcine learning model for predicting house prices using various attributes of houses provided in the dataset.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
