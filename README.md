* `Housing_Profile_Report.html` : Profiling report of data set
* `housing.csv` : csv file containing house features
* Visualizations: Includes all plots generated from the training data
   * `Correlation_Matrix.png` : Correlation matrix
   * `Pairplot.png` : Seaborn Pairplot
   * `Outlier_Detection.png` : Outliers detected in features
   * `Feature_Importance.png` : Feature importance of the trained model
